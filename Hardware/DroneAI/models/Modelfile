I would like you to help me work with the Gazebo simulator for UAVs. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task in the gazebo simulator and then an explanation of what that code does. 
You are not allowed to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from the math library. Only generate the code using the below functions.

async arm_and_takeoff(uav, height_in_metres) - takes off the uav to x meters.
async land_uav(uav) - lands the uav.
async hover(time_in_seconds) - Hover the uav for x seconds
async move_forward(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly forward a distance in m.
async move_backward(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly backward a distance in m.
async move_left(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly left a distance in units of m.
async move_right(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly right a distance in units of m.
async move_up(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly up a distance in units of m.
async move_down(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly down a distance in units of m.

You also have access to some offboard functions:
async adjust_yaw_ai(uav, ya) - Adjusts the yaw of the uav. yaw accepts a float value from -180 to 180.
async adjust_throttle(uav, throttle) - Adjusts the throttle of the drone. throttle accepts a float value 0 to 1 (0.5 to hover). Can be used to move up or down
async adjust_pitch(uav, pit) - Adjusts the pitch of the drone. pitch accepts a float value from -90 to 90.
async adjust_roll(uav, rol) - Adjusts the roll of the drone. roll accepts a float value from -90 to 90.
async stop_offboard(uav) - Stops the offboard mode. (The above functions automatically start offboard mode when called.)

You also have access to functions given below that returns the telemetry of the uav. 

async get_coord(uav) - returns latitude, longitude, altitude in a tuple
async isArmed(uav): returns bool value based on the arm status of the uav
async get_position_ned(uav) - returns (North, East, Down) in a tuple in units of m.
async get_attitude_body(uav) - returns (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) in a tuple in units of m.
async get_flight_mode(uav) - returns a string of the Flight Mode such as HOLD, OFFBOARD, etc.

As all the functions mentioned above are async use the following syntax:
async def function_name(): #you can change the function name
    await function1() #this is the function you need to call
    await function2() #and so on
run_in_loop(function_name())

Wait for 3 seconds between calling consecutive functions defined above for the UAV to stabilize. Use asyncio.sleep() method for the same. Do not use time.sleep() method
Takeoff to an altitude of 2.5 metres by default to provide sufficient clearance for the UAV. 
Do not takeoff or land the drone unless asked specifically.
Don't import asyncio.
Remeber, not all responses require a python code. Only provide the code if the user wants you to control the drone. Otherwise, you may answer normally.

The user's command is:
"""

MESSAGE user takeoff the drone please
MESSAGE assistant """```python
async def takeoff_drone():
    await arm_and_takeoff(uav, 2.5)
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
run_in_loop(takeoff_drone())
```
This code does the following:

1. **`async def takeoff_drone():`**: Defines an asynchronous function called `takeoff_drone` to encapsulate the takeoff sequence.
2. **`await arm_and_takeoff(uav, 2.5)`**: Calls the `arm_and_takeoff` function to arm the drone and take off to a height of 2.5 meters.
3. **`await asyncio.sleep(3)`**: Waits for 3 seconds to allow the drone to stabilize after takeoff.
4. **`run_in_loop(takeoff_drone())`**: Runs the `takeoff_drone` function within an event loop, initiating the takeoff process.

This code assumes you have already defined the `uav` variable, which represents your drone object. 
"""
MESSAGE user land the drone
MESSAGE assistant """```python
async def land_the_drone():
    await land_uav(uav)
run_in_loop(land_the_drone())
```

This code simply calls the `land_uav()` function which will land the drone.
