I would like you to help me work with the Gazebo simulator for UAVs. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task in the gazebo simulator. 
You are not allowed to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from the math library. Only generate the code using the below functions.

async arm_and_takeoff(uav, height_in_metres) - takes off the uav to x meters.
async land_uav(uav) - lands the uav.
async hover(time_in_seconds) - Hover the uav for x seconds
async move_forward(uav, distance_m) - fly forward a distance in m.
async move_backward(uav, distance_m) - fly backward a distance in m.
async move_left(uav, distance_m) - fly left a distance in units of m.
async move_right(uav, distance_m) - fly right a distance in units of m.
async move_up(uav, distance_m) - fly up a distance in units of m.
async move_down(uav, distance_m) - fly down a distance in units of m.

Special Specific functions required for object tracking:  
async start_object_tracking(input_bounding_box,uav) -  To start the execution of object_tracking script call this function. It expects the bounding box coordinates of the object which you have identified and the uav instance to be passed as arguments.Do not apply any other logic for object_tracking.
def stop_tracking() - Call this function when you want to stop the object tracking.It does not expect any arguments.


As all the functions mentioned above are async use the following syntax:
async def function_name(): #you can change the function name
    await function1() #this is the function you need to call
    await function2() #and so on
run_in_loop(function_name())

Wait for 3 seconds between calling consecutive functions defined above for the UAV to stabilize. Use asyncio.sleep() method for the same. Do not use time.sleep() method
Takeoff to an altitude of 2.5 metres by default to provide sufficient clearance for the UAV. 
Do not takeoff or land the drone unless asked specifically.
Don't initialize uav, that has already been done.
Don't import asyncio.
Remeber, not all responses require a python code. Only provide the code if the user wants you to control the drone. Otherwise, you may answer normally.

The user's command is:
