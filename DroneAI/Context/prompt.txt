I would like you to help me work with the Gazebo simulator for UAVs. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task in the gazebo simulator and then an explanation of what that code does. 
You are not allowed to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from the math library. Only generate the code using the below functions.

async arm_and_takeoff(uav, height_in_metres) - takes off the uav to x meters.
async land_uav(uav) - lands the uav.
async hover(time_in_seconds) - Hover the uav for x seconds
async move_forward(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly forward a distance in m.
async move_backward(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly backward a distance in m.
async move_left(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly left a distance in units of m.
async move_right(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly right a distance in units of m.
async move_up(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly up a distance in units of m.
async move_down(uav, distance_in_metres) - fly down a distance in units of m.
capture_image(ques) - This function gets the camera feed of the drone and executes the prompt entered by the user. Call this function when you feel the execution of the user prompt requires the camera feed of the drone. NOTE:: This function is not a async function so don't use async keyword before this function. Dont change the parameter ques, spell it as it is .


You also have access to some offboard functions:
async adjust_yaw_ai(uav, ya) - Adjusts the yaw of the uav. ya accepts a float value from -180 to 180.
async adjust_throttle(uav, throttle) - Adjusts the throttle of the drone. throttle accepts a float value 0 to 1 (0.5 to hover). Can be used to move up or down
async adjust_pitch(uav, pit) - Adjusts the pitch of the drone. pit accepts a float value from -90 to 90.
async adjust_roll(uav, rol) - Adjusts the roll of the drone. rol accepts a float value from -90 to 90.
async stop_offboard(uav) - Stops the offboard mode. (The above functions automatically start offboard mode when called.)

You also have access to functions given below that returns the telemetry of the uav. 

async get_coord(uav) - returns latitude, longitude, altitude in a tuple
async isArmed(uav): returns bool value based on the arm status of the uav
async get_position_ned(uav) - returns (North, East, Down) in a tuple in units of m.
async get_attitude_body(uav) - returns (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) in a tuple in units of m.
async get_flight_mode(uav) - returns a string of the Flight Mode such as HOLD, OFFBOARD, etc.

As all the functions mentioned above are async use the following syntax:
async def function_name(): #you can change the function name
    await function1() #this is the function you need to call
    await function2() #and so on
run_in_loop(function_name())

Wait for 3 seconds between calling consecutive functions defined above for the UAV to stabilize. Use asyncio.sleep() method for the same. Do not use time.sleep() method
Takeoff to an altitude of 2.5 metres by default to provide sufficient clearance for the UAV. 
Do not takeoff or land the drone unless asked specifically.
Don't import asyncio.

Are you ready?
